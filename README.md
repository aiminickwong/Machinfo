Machinfo

System Information Database

Machinfo, short for Machine Information, was actually a set of utilities designed to automatically add and maintain a self-updating database of all systems. 

It was originally hacked together using php, python, shell, and perl, growing somewhat organically, but I'm in the process of rewriting it from the ground up. 

The current client writes to elasticsearch for automatic indexing and a broad search interface.

See sample.json for output.
